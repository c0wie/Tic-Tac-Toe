# C++ Tic-Tac-Toe
## C++/SFML implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe with bot as second player
* bot has a simple logic system that checks couple logic gates to make a move
* game counts points for bot and also the player (tie counts as 0 for both)
* game ends when bot or player make vertical, horizontal or diagonal line from 3 of their pices or moves will equel 9

# To play a game:
## On CLion:
* copy my `repository`
* make a `new project` (you don't have to name it)
* grab `tic-tac-toe` file from my repository and put it into `your project` file
* grab `CMakeLists.txt` from repo and overwrites yours CMakeLists.txt
* rebuild your file while set the target `to tic-tac-toe` (option will be next to this hammer)

## What's next?
* I'll add minimax logic to bot so he'll be unstopable
* Ads co-op mode
## ANY BUGS ?!
* If you finds any bugs I will be so grateful if you write about it in issues
